        <p>This is a blog , is an online journal or informational website displaying information in the reverse chronological order,
             with the latest posts appearing first, at the top. It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.</p>

        <p> The content of a blog typically includes text, pictures, videos, animated GIFs and even scans from old physical offline diaries or journals and other hard copy documents. Since a blog can exist 
         merely for personal use, sharing information with an exclusive group or to engage the public, a blog owner can set their blog for private or public access.
        Blog content can appear as posts on one continuous streaming page or posts on individual pages reachable through one or more pages set up in a list-style format as post title links, excerpts and related tags. 
        All posts or links to posts are typically displayed to readers in reverse chronological order with the most recent content appearing first.
